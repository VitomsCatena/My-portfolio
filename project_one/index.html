<h2>Our Mission, Vision & Values</h2>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>Our goal is to provide humans with the best things nature and our advance technology has to offer<br>
at the best possible time without compromising quality.</p>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>To be the most reliable provider and enhancer of all that is there to be provided.</p>

<h2>Core values</h2>
<h3>RESPECT FOR HUMAN BEINGS AND FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS</h3>
<p>Project-x participants believe that every human being has inherent value and everyone<br>
should be treated with dignity. Every person is equal as a human being and before the law, <br>
and no one person is superior to anyone else.Project-x participants uphold<br>
 all human rights and freedoms expressed in the United Nationsâ€™ Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<br>
  Social justice and equal opportunity are requirements for equality among people.</p>

<h3>RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW</h3>
<p>Project-x participants respect the rule of law. They do not see anyone as above the law,<br>
     and they act within the framework of protection of human dignity, <br>
     universal legal principles, and the laws of their country of residence.<br>
      They manage their organizations in a way to meet or exceed the transparency<br>
       and accountability norms of their society.</p>

<h3>PEACEFUL AND POSITIVE ACTION</h3>
<p>Project-x is a peaceful movement. Project-x participants reject using violence<br>
     as a political tool. Project-x participants prefer positive and constructive actions<br>
      and reject hostility-driven and destructive actions.</p>

<h3>EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN</h3>
<p>Project-x participants are committed to the ideal that women are provided with<br>
     equal opportunity and can contribute to all aspects of society without discrimination,<br>
      and they strive to meet this ideal in all activities.</p>

<h3>ETHICAL ACTION</h3>
<p>Project-x participants pay attention to both ethical norms and moral principles<br>
     in their activities. They abide by fundamental ethical principles including honesty,<br>
      trustworthiness, harmlessness, and fairness. They believe that legitimate and rightful<br>
       goals should be obtained through legitimate and rightful means.</p>

<h3>RESPECT FOR DIVERSITY AND PLURALISM</h3>
<P>Project-x participants see collective and individual diversity as richness as long<br>
     as they do not contradict fundamental human rights. They adopt an attitude<br>
     necessary to avoid conflicts that stem from differences in sacred beliefs.</P>
<h3>VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION AND ALTRUISM</h3>
<p>For Hizmet volunteers, joining activities or leaving them is a personâ€™s individual choice.<br>
     Project-x participants contribute to projects that bring to life their values and benefit<br>
     humanity either through donations or volunteer work.</p>

        <h3>listed below are some of our active projects:</h3>
        <!---projects start-->
        <div id="project1">
            <h4>project re-grow</h4>
        <p>We  have discovered that tissue from pig bladders can be dried into a<br> powder
        called <i>extracellular</i> matrix and used to regrow human fingers. While typical
        mammals heal injuries by growing scar tissue,<br> which prevents any future cell regrowth,</p>
       <p>The cells in the lining of pigâ€™s bladder contain a protein that stimulates a total
        regrowth of tissue,<br> similar to how lizards can regrow their tails.
        So far the treatment has been used to reattach severed fingers,
        develop new fingertips, and even help regenerate<br> the destroyed muscles of an injured Iraq War veteran.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="project2">
   <h4>Project spidey-101</h4>
   <p>We have been able to insert spider silk genes into goats.<br> Why? The goatsâ€™
    milk then contains the protein responsible for<br>the silk, which could then be harvested
     in large quantities.<br>We hope to be able to use the spider silk,
      which can be<br> up to five times stronger than steel,
     to enhance products ranging<br> from artificial limbs to bulletproof vests.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="project3">
                 <h4>The brainiac</h4>
                 <p>Scientists have injected human embryonic stem cells into the brains<br>
                     of fetal mice still in the womb. After the mice were born, the human brain cells<br>
                      developed along with the mouse brain cells, proving that human stem cells<br>
                       can develop into human brain cells in another living animal. Scientists believe<br>
                 this technology could advance research on human brain disorders and improve testing of experimental medications.
                     </p>
        </div>

        <div id="project4">
                    <h4>Hide and <i>SICK</i></h4>
                    <p>Radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips have been implanted in pets for years<br>
             to help identify and return them if lost. But tracking people? The FDA has approved implantation<br>
              in humans, meaning soon prisons, hospitals, and companies could use the chips to track<br>
              peopleâ€™s locations, medical history, and to grant or deny access to rooms and documents.<br>
            Many state correctional facilities are already using the technology to monitor the inmatesâ€™ behavior and location.</p>
            <p>We need volunteers</p>
        </div>

        <div id="project5">
<h4>Project <i>"all seeing"</i></h4>
<p>Funded by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency),we 
     have implanted electrodes in giant flower beetles<br> that allow them to wirelessly
      signal the beetles to turn, take off, or hover mid-flight.
       The Department of Defense hopes to use these technological<br> terrors to assist with search
        and rescue missions and for government surveillance.
 </p>
 <p>Don't tell the government <i>your privacy still matters</i></p>
        </div>

        <div id="project6">
<h4>Nyam-Nyam chom</h4>
<p>Imagine a world where bacon could be grown endlessly! Technology now allows researchers<br> 
    to use pig stem cells to grow pig muscle cells. The results are structurally identical<br>
     to pork thatâ€™s currently consumed, although the muscles do require exercise to become palatable.
     Lab-grown meat could have a huge impact on the planet,<br>
    including feeding the hungry and reducing environmental waste from processing plants.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="project7">
            <h4>project doggy</h4>
            <p>Could Underdog become more than just a comic-book fiction?<br>
                Hereâ€™s a bizarre experiment that toes the line between amazing and terrifying:<br>
                dogs with twice the normal muscle mass.We have developed a way to delete the<br>
                 myostatin gene, which slows muscle growth in animals, from dog embryos. The resulting power<br>
                  pups, Hercules and Tiangou, became the first-ever dogs with edited genes.<br>
We hope the experiment will help lead to a treatment for human diseases like muscular dystrophy.</p>
